## Developed a comprehensive Java-based simulation of a network of routers implementing a Link State routing protocol, closely modeled on OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and Dijkstra's algorithm. This project involved:

Protocol/System Design: Designed the protocol to mimic the OSPF routing protocol, ensuring accurate representation of link state advertisements and updates. Developed a robust system architecture to manage the dynamic interactions between simulated routers.

Algorithm Implementation: Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path for routing decisions. Ensured the simulated routers dynamically updated their link state databases and routing tables based on changes in network topology.

Advanced Features: Enhanced the basic implementation with advanced features such as handling network convergence and detecting route inconsistencies. Implemented mechanisms for fault tolerance and efficient management of network changes.

Testing and Validation: Conducted extensive rigorous testing using various network topologies to validate the correctness and efficiency of the routing protocol. Employed unit testing and simulated real-world scenarios to ensure the system's reliability and performance.

Java Technologies: Utilized core Java for the development, including advanced data structures and multithreading to simulate concurrent network operations and router interactions. Implemented detailed logging for debugging and performance monitoring.

This project demonstrated my ability to design and implement complex network protocols, my proficiency in Java, and my commitment to rigorous testing and validation processes.
